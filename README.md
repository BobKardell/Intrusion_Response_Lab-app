# Intrusion_Response_Lab-app
Intrusion Response Lab application only
The Lab is a small, fast, extensible, portable intrusion application to conduct an investigation on an Windows based machine.

The application is:
  Small - only uses a few megabytes of space for the full application.
  Fast - in that limited searches only take a few seconds or minutes to run.
  Extensible - the application is designed to read and incorporate changes to several support files.
  Portable - the application does not require any installation to run; the exe will run with the supporting directories and support files in the same directory.
  
  The repository has two directories - an installable version of the application and the portable, zip version.
  
  The installable version will install to Windows like any other application
  
  The portable version is probably the most useful version.  The portable can be unzipped and placed on a USB drive for running on different Windows machines.
  
  A help file or how-to file is in the works and will be uploaded shortly.
